   Uncertainty Propagation in Wildland Fire Behaviour Modelling
   ============================================================


1. FUEL TYPE PROPERTY FILES
---------------------------

Each file in this directory describes one of 13 NFFL fuel types such
that it can be used as an input file for the JAVA-classes "BehaveTest"
and "BehaveDerivTest". The files are conformant with the format that
is given by the JAVA-class "java.util.Properties".



2. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE "PROPERTIES-FORMAT"
-----------------------------------------------

For a complete reference visit please the documentation of
"Properties" (e.g. at
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html).
Nevertheless, if you have a look at the files, you will find it very
easy to edit them according your needs. The basic rules are:

 - A line that contains only whitespace or whose first non-whitespace
   character is an ASCII # or ! is ignored (thus, # or ! indicate
   comment lines). 

 - Each line is considered a property (a key and element pair).

 - key and element are separated by the sign "=" or ":"

 - element consist basically of all characters after "=" or ":".

Some Example:
  car = renault
  number_of_loops = 100
but, also
  fruits = banana, apple, orange



3. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF "BEHAVEDERIV-PROPERTIES-FORMAT"
-------------------------------------------------------

For the uncertainty propagation we need for every input variable
(=key) two values (=element): the expectation and the standard
deviation. E.g. the line

    w0_d1 =    1.705                0.1705

means that the variable "w0_d1" (= fuel loading of dead fuel <0.6cm)
has an expectation value of 1.705 [kg/m2] with a standard deviation of
0.1705 [kg/m2].

If you do not specify a standard deviation the program assumes that
the variable is a constant.
